# Snow Depth Prediction using L-Band InSAR Products

## Overview

This work serves as a proof-of-concept that InSAR products can be used to estimate total snow depth through Machine Learning. This repository contains the code used to generate all results in the our paper (link will follow shortly).

## Dataset

This work uses dataset from the 2017 SnowEx Campaign. The InSAR data is from NASA JPL's UAVSAR sensor, and the Lidar Depth is from ASO.
